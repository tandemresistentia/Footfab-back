## Introduction

Footfab-back is the backend component of the Footfab project, a footwear recommendation system designed to help users discover their perfect pair of shoes. This backend is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and is responsible for handling data processing, user interactions, and providing the necessary functionalities to the frontend application.

The main goal of the Footfab project is to offer a personalized and interactive shoe shopping experience by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and historical data to make accurate recommendations.

**Note:** This repository specifically focuses on the Django backend implementation. For the frontend part, please refer to the [Footfab-front](https://github.com/tandemresistentia/Footfab-front) repository.

## Features

- User authentication and registration
- Shoe recommendation based on user preferences
- Filtering and sorting of shoe options
- User feedback collection to improve recommendations
- CRUD operations for shoes, user profiles, and feedback data

## Installation

To run the Footfab-back backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tandemresistentia/Footfab-back.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Footfab-back
   ```

3. Install the Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the necessary environment variables (database connection, API keys, etc.).

5. Run the Django development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, the backend API endpoints will be available to interact with the frontend application. The frontend application will use these endpoints to retrieve shoe recommendations, process user feedback, and perform various other functionalities.

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) section below.
